# WeatherSearch-Angular-Node

A webpage that allows users to search for weather information using the Forecast.io API and display the results on the same page below the form. The user provides the location information such as Street address, City and State for which they would want to find the detailed weather information or provide their current location. Once the user has provided the data and clicks on the Search button, validation will be done to check that the entered data is valid. Once the validation is successful, three tabs will be displayed. The three tabs correspond to Current tab, Hourly tab and Weekly tab. The webpage will also support adding cities to and removing cities from the Favorites tab and sharing the weather info with Twitter.
